----COMMERCE HARBOR FZE - to shape the future --------------

When I was pursuing UI/UX design, I got an opportunity to work with a team and to polish my skills in Web designing. That time I was not doing development along with that so the website was developed by another developer. 

Now I am familiar with React as well, so thought to code my own designed website. That improves my thought process as well as  got a chance to upskill myself in React.
